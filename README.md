# GPT4-Terminal
This is just a basic script that will let you use GPT4 in a Terminal

To use it open the "GPT4.py" file and place your GPT4 key where it says "Your-GPT4-Key-Here"

Then just start the script with "python GPT4.py" and start writing, you can use the enter key to make a new line meaning you can copy and paste chunks of code into this script to be sent to GPT4, once you have finished writing and want to send the request to GPT4 you NEED to press enter to make a clear new line and type "!fin" and press enter, that acts as the finish command to send the text to GPT4.

Then just wait for the reply, some times the reply may take a while depending on how much text you send it.
