# GPT4-Terminal
This is just a basic script that will let you use GPT4 in a Terminal

To use it open the "GPT4.py" file and place your GPT4 key where it says "Your-GPT4-Key-Here"

Then just start the script and start writing, you can use the enter key to make a new line
once you have finished writing and want to send the request to GPT-4 
you NEED to press enter and type "!fin" and press enter
that acts as the finish command to send the text to GPT4
then just wait for the reply.
